This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern as Data Science and Business Analytics for [The Sparks Foundation](https://www.thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/)

### Tools/IDE : Python/Jupyter Notebook


### # Task 1 : Prediction using Supervised Learning (Level - Beginner)

1. Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
1. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
1. Data can be found at [http://bit.ly/w-data](http://bit.ly/w-data)
1. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
1. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?


### # Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
1. From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
1. Use R or Python or perform this task.
1. Data can be found at [https://bit.ly/3kXTdox](https://bit.ly/3kXTdox)


### # Task-3 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail (Level - Beginner)
1. As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
1. What all business probelms you van derive by exploring the data.
1. You can use any tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)
3. Data can be be found at [https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl](https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl)


### # Task-4 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism (Level - Intermediate)
1. Perform the Exploratory Data Analysis on 'Global Terrorism'.
2. As a security/defence analyst, try to find out hot zone of terrorism.
3. What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?
4. You can use any tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)
5. Data can be be found at [https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5](https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5)


### # Task-5 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports (Level - Advanced)
1. Perform the Exploratory Data Analysis on 'Indian Premier League'.
2. As a sports analyst, find out the most successfull teams, players, factors contributing win or loss of a team.
3. Suggest the teams or players a company should endorse for its products.
4. You can use any tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)
5. Data can be be found at [https://bit.ly/34SRn3b](https://bit.ly/34SRn3b)


### # Task-6 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (Level - Intermediate)
1. Create a decision tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
2. The purpose if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
3. Data can be be found at [https://bit.ly/3kXTdox](https://bit.ly/3kXTdox)

### # Task-7 : Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Texual Analysis (Level - Advanced)
1. Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines.
2. Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX(S&P BSE SENSEX)
3. Download historical stock prices from [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
4. Download texual(news) data from [https://bit.ly/36fFPI6](https://bit.ly/36fFPI6)
5. Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then combine the findings to create a hybrid model.
6. You are free to select **different** stock to analysis and news dataset as well while not changing the **objective** of the task.
